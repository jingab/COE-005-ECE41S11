# COE-005-ECE41S11

Hi hi hiii!!!~~ I am gab and here is my repository for the compilation of all the activities I did for this subject/course.

Currently taking COE 005-ECE41S11 - Prediction and Machine Learning and on the road to be a data scientist :thinking: also am a 4th year ECE student.

I would like to express my genuine gratitude to our professor, Engr. Christian Rioflorido for being interactive, approachable and making this course to be fun while we learn lots of different things through various activities and to note that it is only for a very limited time, which is six (6) weeks.
